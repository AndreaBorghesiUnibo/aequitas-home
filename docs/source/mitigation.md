# AI Bias Mitigation
## Introduction
### What is Bias Mitigation?
Bias mitigation refers to the set of techniques and strategies used to reduce or eliminate unjustified biases that can emerge in AI models. These biases can arise from skewed training data, unbalanced algorithms, or other sources that reflect human or structural prejudices. 
### Why is it important?
Bias mitigation is crucial to ensure that AI systems are fair, inclusive, and non-discriminatory, thereby promoting more accurate and just decisions in applications ranging from hiring processes to medical diagnosis.
## Mitigation Approaches
Bias mitigation approaches in artificial intelligence refer to the various strategies and techniques designed to identify, reduce, and eliminate biases within AI models and their training processes. 

These biases can stem from historical data, algorithmic structures, or even unintended human biases encoded within the data. By applying these approaches, we can enhance the fairness, accuracy, and inclusivity of AI systems.

The most common approaches in implementing bias mitigation practices are 3:
### Pre-procesing
Pre-processing approaches aim to modify the input data before it is used to train AI models. The goal is to remove or reduce biases present in the raw data.
There are a variety of ways to do this, the most common being:
- **Data Rebalancing**:
Adjusting the dataset to ensure a fair distribution of classes, for example, by undersampling majority classes or oversampling minority classes.
- **Anonymization**:
Removing or masking sensitive attributes (such as gender, ethnicity) to prevent them from influencing the model.
- **Data Transformation**:
Applying techniques like normalization or encoding to reduce the impact of biases in the data.
### In-Processing
In-processing approaches focus on improving algorithms and training techniques to prevent the introduction of bias during the model building phase.
There are a variety of ways to do this, the most common being:
- **Adversarial Regularization**:
Adding specific loss terms during training and use of an adversarial model during training of the main model. The goal is to penalize the model when it makes predictions based on sensitive attributes.
- **Fair Representation Learning**:
Learning data representations that are independent of sensitive attributes. This method ensures that the internal representations used by the model do not capture information related to these attributes, promoting unbiased predictions.
- **Fairness Constraints Methods**:
Incorporating fairness constraints directly into the optimization process of the learning algorithm. Examples include adding fairness metrics such as demographic parity or equalized odds as additional terms in the loss function.
### Post-Processing
Post-processing approaches are applied after the model has been trained, aiming to correct any biases present in the model’s predictions.
There are a variety of ways to do this, the most common being:
- **Equalized Odds Post-Processing**: Ensuring that the model’s predictions have similar true positive and false positive rates across different groups. This involves adjusting the decision thresholds for each group to achieve similar error rates.
- **Calibration**: Recalibrating predicted probabilities to ensure they are reliable and equitably distributed across various groups.
- **Reject Option Classification**: Giving the option to defer decisions when the model is uncertain, particularly in cases where predictions could be unfair. This allows for human oversight in critical decisions, improving fairness.
